<h2>AnonNews is not just for AnonOps.</h2>
<p>AnonNews was made for anything involving Anonymous - that means you do not need to be affiliated or involved with a specific network or group. No matter
who you are affiliated with - or whether you are affiliated with anything or anyone at all! - you're welcome to post on AnonNews, as long as you follow the
same relevancy guidelines as everyone else (everything that does not fit in the main sections, can generally go in the forum).</p>
<p>AnonNews also does not promote any particular group or network over another - this is a 'neutral' site, not taking any sides.</p>
<p>We would also like to remind you that AnonOps does not equal Anonymous, and that no single group or network can be representative of Anonymous as a whole.
If anyone claims to 'represent' Anonymous, he lies - no exceptions. Anonymous is also not a democratic body, which means a majority of anons (if this is
something that can be measured in the first place) can not be considered representative of Anonymous either.</p>
