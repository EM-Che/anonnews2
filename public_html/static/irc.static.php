<h2>IRC</h2>
<p>AnonNews has an IRC channel on <a href="http://www.cryto.net/irc">Cryto IRC</a>, for support, questions, moderator applications, and general chit-chat. TOR users are welcome, however abusing IPs will
receive a temporary ban from the network. If you cannot connect through a TOR node, VPN, or proxy, please try using a different TOR identity / proxy / VPN IP. An I2P tunnel is planned, but not yet operational.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> AnonNews is not affiliated with AnonOps or any other Anonymous-related website, network, or infrastructure. If you have complaints about an Anonymous Operation, please directly
contact those responsible for the organization - AnonNews has nothing to do with it, and is just a news platform.</p>
