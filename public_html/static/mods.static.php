<h2>AnonNews is looking for moderators!</h2>
<p>We are looking for people that have the time (and capability) to moderate incoming submissions. The most important requirements for being a moderator:</p>
<ul>
	<li>You must be able to moderate submissions solely based on relevancy. You must be able to leave out your own personal morals in moderation.</li>
	<li>You must be present in the AnonNews (staff) IRC channel regularly.</li>
	<li>You must be tech-savvy enough to distinguish potentially harmful links from genuine links.</li>
	<li>You must have read and understood the guidelines for the submission of press releases, external news, and related sites.</li>
	<li>You must be able to speak and understand English.</li>
</ul>
<p>Being a moderator does not require an e-mail address, real name, or any other personally identifiable information - all that is needed is a username and a password.</p>
<p>Be aware that all moderation decisions are logged, and that intentionally bad moderation or unwillingness to follow the guidelines may result in your moderator account being disabled.
This includes exercising moderation based on personal morals.</p>
<p>To apply for being a moderator, <a href="/static/irc">join the IRC channel</a>.</p>
